Please excuse the audio I am testing out a Blue Yeti and I had the gain up too much, better than the first time when I didn't have the damn thing plugged in.

One of the design elements of my lab is that it needs to be portable.

This carry case, which is an unused camera case, includes my test instruments which right now are kinda basic.

This was a lazy Sunday build using exercise mats as the foam for the custom cutouts.

TIP: Use a really sharp knife and change the blades, the exercise foam really dulls them quickly.

Shout out to Julian Lett for inspiration and humor.
