This video is a deconstruction of 3 items from the local surplus center.

It was an attempt to salvage the meters which I seem to have a fetish for.

This deconstruction was mostly a bust.

One of the cases was a Motorola radio testing kit that had possibilities for a steampunk case for some future project.

Any suggestions and feedback are appreciated.
