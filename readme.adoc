Requirements for as simple a solution as possible for a PHP movie catalog web page.

== Introduction

GeekMustHave is a combination of website blog and YouTube channel.

Blog: https://GeekMustHave.com

YouTube: https://YouTube/c/GeekMustHave

GMH needs a Video Catalog page that allows for display of Video Catalog with playback and download.

Not all of GMH video work is on YouTube.  Some of it is related only to a blog post or an response from other web sites that are connected to GeekMust have.

The solution requested is a PHP based solution which will run in a directory under the WordPress directory on the GMH Blog.  The WorkPress site is run on a co-hosted server managed by BlueCloud.

All WordPress plugin's are far too complex and require databases and login procedures.
The Video Catalog requested needs to be as simple as possible.

== Requirements

. As simple a solution as possible
. File based only, no databases
. Show an alphabetical list of videos (MP4) from a folder based on video file name
. Show an associated description text from another folder
. Turn text that represents a hyperlink into a clickable link into a new page
. Not all videos will have descriptions
. Allow for search on Video Name or text description
. Avoid using code that pre-loads all of the videos on the page
. Use thumbnail PNG images for video catalog page from another folder
. File names may contain spaces
. Not all videos will have thumbnails, missing thumbnail replace with standard PNG
(Thumbnail Pending)
. Allow for 5 videos on a page with paging controls on bottom of page
. Allow the number of videos on page to be set within PHP code
. Prefer a single PHP file solution


== Structure

The file structure for the Video Catalog will be maintained outside of the Video Catalog PHP page.

There is an automated process that will automatically copy the proper set of files for a video into the proper directories.

The file names for the Description, Thumbnail and Video will all be identical, with exception of the file extension.

.File Extensions
. txt - Description
. png - Thumbnail
. mp4 - Video

=== Folder / File Structure

The following is what the folder / file structure will be for the Video Catalog.

== Video Catalog Page Requirements

This are the requirements for the single Video Catalog page.

. The flat button style is preferred.
. The paging controls can be different as long as they have
.. First page
.. Previous Page
.. Page x of y
.. Next Page
.. Last Page
. Tooltip opens when user hovers over a button
. Download allows for the video to be downloaded
. Clicking on the Video thumbnail plays the video 
.. Video player should allow for full screen and an escape from full screen
.. Video player should allow for quickly moving around the video
.. Video Player should have a Play/Pause button or control, space bar is good for this
. The YouTube ICON would transfer the user to the GeekMustHave YouTubeChannel in a New page

=== Video Page Prototype

The following is an example of the layout for the single Video Catalog page.
